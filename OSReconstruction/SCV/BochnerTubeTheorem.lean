# Bochner's Tube Theorem

If F is holomorphic on a tube domain T(C) = {z in C^m : Im(z) in C} where C is open,
then F extends to a holomorphic function on T(conv C) = {z : Im(z) in conv(C)}.

## Main results

* `isOpen_convexHull_of_isOpen` -- the convex hull of an open set in `Fin m -> R` is open
  (sorry-free)
* `bochner_tube_extension` -- the main theorem (depends on `bochner_local_extension`)

## Proof structure

**Sorry-free results:**
* `isOpen_convexHull_of_isOpen`
* Tube domain infrastructure (open, connected, containment)
* `bochner_tube_extension` (proved from `bochner_local_extension` + identity theorem)

**Sorry results (2 sorries):**
* `bochner_local_extension` -- local holomorphic extension at each point of T(conv C)
  (core analytical content: Cauchy integral on polydiscs)
* `holomorphic_extension_from_local` -- DifferentiableOn part only; the agreement
  part (f_ext = f on U) is sorry-free. Needs the identity theorem consistency argument.

/-! ### Local extension at each point -/

/-- **Local Bochner extension**: For each z in T(conv C), there is an open
    neighborhood U of z in T(conv C) and a holomorphic function G on U that
    agrees with F on T(C) intersect U.

    The construction uses the Cauchy integral formula on polydiscs centered at z
    with contours in T(C). Im(z) is in the open set conv(C), so there is a
    polydisc around z whose distinguished boundary has imaginary parts in C (by
    the convex hull characterization + openness of C). The Cauchy integral
    on this polydisc defines G, which is holomorphic by differentiation under
    the integral sign.

/-! ### Global extension from local extensions

The global patching argument: given local holomorphic extensions at every point of
a connected domain D that agree with a holomorphic function f on a nonempty open
subset U of D, the identity theorem forces consistency, yielding a global extension.

In our case, D = T(conv C), U = T(C), f = F.
-/

/-- **Local-to-global holomorphic extension on connected domains.**

If D is a connected open set in C^m, U is a nonempty open subset of D,
f is holomorphic on U, and at every point z of D there is a local holomorphic
extension of f (agreeing with f on U), then f extends to a holomorphic function
on D.

The construction defines F_ext(z) = G_z(z) where G_z is any local extension at z.
Well-definedness follows from the identity theorem: any two local extensions
G_z, G_w that agree with f on U must agree on U_z cap U_w (since U is nonempty
open and connected to both U_z and U_w through D). -/

  -- The proof uses the open-closed argument on the connected set D.
  --
  -- Define S = {z in D : there exists an open V containing z and a function g
  -- holomorphic on V with g = f on U cap V}. Then S is open by definition.
  -- D \ S is also open: if z is in D \ S, then the local extension G_z at z
  -- is holomorphic on V_z and agrees with f on U cap V_z; this contradicts
  -- z not in S unless the local extension at z is not the "global" one,
  -- which can't happen because the local extension exists for every z in D.
  --
  -- Actually, S = D by hypothesis (every z in D has a local extension).
  -- The subtlety is CONSISTENCY: the local extensions must glue coherently.
  --
  -- Standard approach: define f_ext via the identity theorem.
  -- Since D is connected and U is a nonempty open subset, any holomorphic function
  -- on D is uniquely determined by its values on U.
  --
  -- Construction:
  -- 1. Choose local extensions G_z at each z in D
  -- 2. Define f_ext(z) = G_z(z)
  -- 3. Show f_ext is well-defined (consistency via identity theorem)
  -- 4. Show f_ext is holomorphic (local agreement with holomorphic G_z)
  -- 5. Show f_ext = f on U
  --
  -- Steps 3 and 4 require showing G_z(w) = G_w(w) for overlapping domains.
  -- This uses the identity theorem: G_z and G_w agree on U (nonempty open),
  -- so they agree on any connected component of V_z cap V_w meeting U.
  -- Since D is connected, every point is reachable from U, so by induction
  -- along chains of overlapping neighborhoods, consistency propagates.
  --
  -- This is the standard monodromy theorem / sheaf gluing for connected domains.
  -- The formal proof requires careful handling of the chain argument.
