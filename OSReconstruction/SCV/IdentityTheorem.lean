# Identity Theorem for Several Complex Variables

This file provides the identity theorem (uniqueness of analytic continuation)
for holomorphic functions of several complex variables, together with the
Hartogs analyticity bridge from ℂ-differentiability to analyticity.

## Main results

* `DifferentiableOn.analyticOnNhd_of_finiteDimensional` — Hartogs analyticity:
  ℂ-Fréchet differentiable on an open set implies analytic (sorry: requires
  iterated Cauchy integral formula)
* `identity_theorem_SCV` — identity theorem for `f, g : ℂᵐ → ℂ`:
  if they agree on a nonempty open subset of a connected open set, they agree everywhere
* `identity_theorem_tubeDomain` — specialization to tube domains `ℝᵐ + iC`

## Mathematical Background

In one complex variable, `DifferentiableOn.analyticOnNhd` (Mathlib) gives
holomorphic ⟹ analytic via Cauchy's integral formula. The identity theorem
then follows from isolated zeros of analytic functions.

In several complex variables (ℂⁿ, n ≥ 2), the same implications hold but
with a crucial difference: zero sets can be complex hypersurfaces (codimension 1),
so agreement at a cluster point is insufficient. Instead, agreement on an
open set (or equivalently, `f =ᶠ[nhds z₀] g`) is required.

The proof of Hartogs analyticity uses iterated Cauchy integrals: fix all
variables except one, apply the 1D Cauchy formula, then assemble the
multivariate power series. This is ~200 LOC of careful analysis not yet
in Mathlib.

/-! ### Hartogs Analyticity -/

/-- **Hartogs' analyticity theorem** for several complex variables:
    A function `f : ℂᵐ → F` that is ℂ-Fréchet differentiable on an open set
    is analytic (has convergent power series expansions) on that set.

    In one complex variable, this is `DifferentiableOn.analyticOnNhd` in Mathlib
    (proved via Cauchy's integral formula). In several variables, the proof uses
    iterated Cauchy integrals: fix all variables except one, apply the 1D result,
    then use the Cauchy integral representation to get the multi-variable power series.

    This is NOT the same as Hartogs' separate analyticity theorem (which says
    separately holomorphic implies jointly holomorphic). This is the simpler fact
    that jointly ℂ-differentiable implies analytic.

/-! ### Identity Theorem -/

/-- **Identity theorem for several complex variables**: if two holomorphic functions
    on a connected open set `U ⊂ ℂᵐ` agree in a neighborhood of some point `z₀ ∈ U`,
    they agree on all of `U`.

    This is the several-variable generalization of `identity_theorem_connected`
    (EdgeOfWedge.lean). The key difference from 1D: in ℂⁿ (n ≥ 2), zero sets
    of holomorphic functions can be complex hypersurfaces, so agreement at a
    cluster point is NOT sufficient — we need agreement on an open set
    (i.e., `f =ᶠ[nhds z₀] g`).

    Proof: from Hartogs analyticity (`analyticOnNhd_of_finiteDimensional`) and
    Mathlib's `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`.

/-- Identity theorem for tube domains: two holomorphic functions on a tube domain
    `T(C) = ℝᵐ + iC` (where C is a nonempty open convex cone) that agree in a
    neighborhood of some point must agree on the entire tube domain.

    Tube domains are connected (since C is convex), so this follows directly
    from `identity_theorem_SCV`. -/
